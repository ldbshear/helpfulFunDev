  Like most people, Covid disrupted my family's way of life. I went from
  interviewing for in-person software developer jobs, to teaching my elementary
  age kids. Different personalities, different sensory needs, different
  temperaments, different strengths and weaknesses. Disaster right? No.

  In an environment of accountability, flexibilty, and various learning
  supports, they've gained confidence in their ability to learn. As a mother,
  I'm grateful for online applications that present or reinforce learning
  concepts. And as a developer, it excites me to code something that could help
  someone, gain confidence in their abilities.
